Nationstar Mortgage withheld money from my monthly house payment to fund an Escrow account from which they are to pay property taxes. They used the funds from my account to pay taxes on someone else 's property - landing me in collections with the XXXX County tax department. They have since paid off the collections, but are showing the additional amount as being part of my payoff amount ( meaning they are charging me XXXX for property taxes ). When my attorney and I have requested that they update the payoff since it was not my error, they are not helping me. They have told me they have to wait for the refund from XXXX County. When I contacted XXXX County, they advised me they do not refund mortgage companies for issues such as this. They said the mortgage company has to request the funds from the owner of the property that they erroneously paid. Nationstar is now saying they did not make a mistake. My attorney has documentation showing the issue and that I am being penalized for this, which is making it impossible for me to refinance my loan to a lower interest rate ( this is how we noticed the issue ). I have spent literally hours trying to get this resolved - many times being disconnected and given incorrect call back numbers or numbers that route to the wrong department. I also gave each of the representatives my call back number and no one has called me back. I left several messages with XXXX in the tax department and she never returned my calls. I want to move my loan from this company ( which could be accomplished through a refi ), but they are showing me as owing {$6000.00} more than I should, which means I would have to come out of pocket and hope for a reimbursement at some point.
