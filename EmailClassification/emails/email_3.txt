I have a car loan with PNC bank. In XXXX of 2014 I sent a payment of {$250.00} in the form of a money order. PNC bank lost my payment. After that mishap I began to submit. my payments online, via bill payment. Now this month I submitted a payment of {$300.00}, online as before, they will not release the money to my account. I have proof that I sent the payment and PNC bank still refuses to accept the payment.
